<h2>Uttar Pradesh</h2>

<h1>Uttar Pradesh</h1> 
<p  style="font-size:160%;">Uttar Pradesh ranks first in domestic tourist arrivals among all states of India.[249][250] Some 44,000 foreign tourists arrived in the state in 2021, and almost 110 million domestic tourists.[251] The Taj Mahal attracts some 7 million people a year, earning almost ₹78 crore (US$9.8 million) in ticket sales in 2018–19.[252] The state is home to three World Heritage Sites: the Taj Mahal,[253] Agra Fort,[254] and the nearby Fatehpur Sikri.[255]

    Religious tourism is an important element. Varanasi is a major religious hub and one of the seven sacred cities (Sapta Puri) in Hinduism and Jainism.[256][257][258] Vrindavan is considered to be a holy place for Vaishnavism.[259][260] Owing to the belief as to the birthplace of Rama, Ayodhya (Awadh) has been regarded as one of the seven most important pilgrimage sites.[261][262][263] Millions gather at Prayagraj to take part in the Magh Mela festival on the banks of the Ganges.[264] This festival is organised on a larger scale every 12th year and is called the Kumbh Mela, where over 10 million Hindu pilgrims congregate in one of the largest gatherings of people in the world.[265]
    
    Buddhist attractions in Uttar Pradesh include stupas and monasteries. The historically important towns of Sarnath where Gautama Buddha gave his first sermon after his enlightenment and died at Kushinagar; both are important pilgrimage sites for Buddhists.[266] Also at Sarnath are the Pillars of Ashoka and the Lion Capital of Ashoka, both important archaeological artefacts with national significance. At a distance of 80 km (50 miles) from Varanasi, Ghazipur is famous not only for its Ghats on the Ganges but also for the tomb of Lord Cornwallis, the 18th-century Governor of East India Company ruled Bengal Presidency. The tomb is maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India.[267]
