<h1>Mysore</h1> 
<p  style="font-size:160%;">Mysore  is a metropolitan city in the southern Indian state of Karnataka.[6] It is the third-most populous and third-largest city in the state,[7] and is one of the cleanest cities in India. It is the seat of the Wadiyar dynasty and was the capital of the Kingdom of Mysore for almost six centuries, from 1399 until 1947. It is currently the headquarters of Mysore district and Mysore division. Known for its heritage structures and palaces, including the famous Mysore Palace, and noted for its culture, Mysore is popularly known as the "City of Palaces", the "Heritage City",[8] and the "Cultural Capital of Karnataka".[9] For its pristine and calm ambience, it is also known as "Pensioners' Paradise".[10][tone]

    Mysore is situated at the foothills of the Chamundi Hills. At an altitude of 770 m (2,530 ft) above mean sea level, the city of Mysore is geographically located at 12° 18′ 26″ north latitude and 76° 38′ 59″ east longitude. It is about 140 km (87.0 mi) southwest of the state's capital, Bangalore, and spreads across an area of 156 km2 (60 sq mi)(City + neighbouring census towns).[11] The population of the city combined with its neighbouring towns in its metropolitan area is about 12,88,000 in 2023 [12]
    
    Most of the city's development during modern times could be attributed to the maharajas of Mysore and the Wadiyar dynasty, who were patrons of art and culture. Hyder Ali and Tipu, when they were briefly in power in succession, also contributed significantly to the economic growth of the city and the kingdom by planting mulberry trees and silk in the region, and fighting four wars against the British. In present days, the Mysore City Corporation is responsible for the civic administration of the city.
    
    During the Dasara festivals, Mysore receives hundreds of thousands of tourists from around the world. The city is also the namesake to various art forms and culture, such as Mysore Dasara and Mysore painting; eateries such as the sweet delicacy Mysore Pak, breakfasts like Mysore Dosa and Mysore Masala Dosa; brands such as Mysore Sandal Soap, Mysore Paints; and styles and cosmetics such as Mysore Peta, a traditional silk turban, and the Mysore silk saris. Mysore is also known for betel leaves and its own special variety of jasmine flower fondly referred to as "Mysore Mallige". Tourism is a lifeline industry for the city alongside the traditional industries. Mysore's intracity public transportation includes bus and intercity public transportation includes rail, bus, and air.
